//! Invariant tests for `BillPayments::bulk_cleanup_bills`.
//!
//! # Accounting contract for bulk_cleanup_bills
//!
//! `bulk_cleanup_bills(caller, before_timestamp)` permanently deletes every
//! entry in `ARCH_BILL` whose `archived_at < before_timestamp`.  After the
//! call the following invariants **must** hold for **every** owner:
//!
//! 1. **Ownership scoping** – only archived bills belonging to the caller are
//!    eligible for removal; a non-owner cannot trigger deletion of another
//!    owner's archived bills (auth is on the caller, the scan is global, but
//!    each `ARCH_IDX` entry is per-owner).
//! 2. **ARCH_IDX accuracy** – `get_archived_bills` returns no stale IDs for
//!    any bill that was removed.
//! 3. **OWN_IDX unaffected** – `get_owner_bill_count` (active index) is
//!    unchanged; cleanup only touches the archive, not active bills.
//! 4. **UNPD_TOT unaffected** – `get_total_unpaid` is unchanged; archived
//!    bills were already excluded from the unpaid total at archive time.
//! 5. **get_owner_bill_count reflects removed count** – the caller's archived
//!    index shrinks by exactly the number of deleted bills.
//! 6. **Idempotency** – re-running cleanup with the same (or larger)
//!    `before_timestamp` on already-removed IDs is a safe no-op that returns
//!    `Ok(0)`.
//! 7. **Mixed-state correctness** – cleanup spanning paid + unpaid + archived
//!    bills leaves active/unpaid state untouched and removes only qualifying
//!    archived records.
//! 8. **Empty-set safety** – cleanup of an empty archive returns `Ok(0)`.
//! 9. **Owner-index emptied completely** – cleanup that removes every archived
//!    bill for an owner leaves a clean, empty archive index for that owner.
//! 10. **Overflow safety** – `i128` totals are never corrupted by cleanup.
