#![cfg(test)]

/// # Exactly-once delivery invariant for `execute_due_savings_schedules`
///
/// The executor is permissionless and may be invoked multiple times within the
/// same Stellar ledger (which shares a single ledger timestamp), or retried
/// after a transient failure. The critical invariant is:
///
/// - A schedule that becomes due credits its linked goal's `current_amount` by
///   exactly `schedule.amount` on the **first** execution within that due window.
/// - Subsequent calls in the same ledger (same timestamp) must NOT credit the
///   goal again — for recurring schedules the `next_due > current_time` guard
///   blocks re-entry after `next_due` is advanced; for one-shot schedules the
///   `active = false` flag blocks re-entry.
/// - Multiple distinct schedules targeting the same goal each contribute their
///   own `amount` in one executor pass; amounts accumulate with checked
///   arithmetic so balances near `MAX_SAFE_GOAL_BALANCE` do not overflow.
///
/// ## Locked-goal behavior
/// The executor does NOT check `goal.locked`. Locking a goal only prevents
/// manual withdrawals via `withdraw_from_goal`. Scheduled credits to a locked
/// goal proceed normally — this is intentional and allows automated saving to
/// continue even when the goal is protected from withdrawal.
///
/// ## Archived-goal behavior (documented gap)
/// When a goal is archived via `archive_goal`, it is moved from
/// `DataKey::Goal` to `DataKey::ArchivedGoal`. The executor looks up
/// `DataKey::Goal`, finds `None`, and silently `continue`s — the scheduled
/// credit is **dropped** and `missed_count` is **not** incremented for that
/// skip. Callers should cancel outstanding schedules before archiving their
/// linked goals to avoid silent credit drops.
