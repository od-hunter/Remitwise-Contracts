//! Tests for GoalCompleted event-emission at exact target-amount boundary.
//!
//! # Single-emission guarantee
//!
//! The contract emits `SavingsEvent::GoalCompleted` (carrying a `GoalCompletedEvent`)
//! exactly once per goal, on the contribution that first brings
//! `current_amount >= target_amount`. Subsequent contributions to the same
//! goal must NOT re-emit the event, ensuring downstream indexers and
//! notification services are not double-triggered.
